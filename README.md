YAIOCGOL

> Yet another implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Test-first approach to building a console version using JavaScript (Node.js v6).

## Using

After `npm install`, use `npm start` to see a random environment. Press `ESC` key to stop it.

To specify the size of the environment, pass in the number of rows and columns. For example, an environment 100 columns wide by 70 rows high would be started using `npm start 70 100`.

## Next

This is just a quick implementation. The next step is to refactor and make the implementation more interesting :wink:
