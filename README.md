> Yet another implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Test-first approach to building a console version using JavaScript (Node.js v6).

## Using

After `npm install`, use `npm start` to see a random environment. Press `ESC` key to stop it.

## Next

This is just a quick implementation. The next step is to refactor and make the implementation more interesting :wink:
